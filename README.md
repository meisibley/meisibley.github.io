#### About
Full-stack Engineer: Currently enrolled at Atlas School to study full-stack development skills.
Software Engineer work experience (in Financial & Telecom Industries): Using my programming knowledge and skills to develop and maintain software solutions.

After obtaining my Master's degree in Computer Science from OCU, I got a job as a software programmer at a telecommunications company in Tulsa. While this experience was rewarding, I eventually transitioned to focus on family. Now, with a renewed passion for programming and a desire to build web applications, I am pursuing a career as a software developer or full-stack engineer or both.
